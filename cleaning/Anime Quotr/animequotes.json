","Author":" Roy Mustang","Summary":"__Birthday:__ 1885 (Age 30 from vol. 10)\n__Height:__ 5'8\" (173 cm)   \n\nOutwardly arrogant and playfully manipulative, Mustang is intelligent and almost always one step ahead of his opponents, and likes to feel in control of the situation. He is one of the superiors of Edward Elric. On the surface, he appears to be nothing more than a man of the military who pursues promotions and praise and is considered a ladies' man who constantly goes on dates with different women. Mustang's true goal is to become F\u00fchrer in order to gain the power to reform the government in order to absolve his sins in the Ishval War as well as change the country for the better, along with the joking requirement for female officers to wear tiny miniskirts (which considerably increased Havoc's loyalty to him and caused Hawkeye to be angry with him).   His goals are admirable enough that he earns the fierce loyalty of his good friends Lt Col. Maes Hughes, Major Alex Louis Armstrong, and his own subordinates, among whom are Riza Hawkeye, Jean Havoc, Heymans Breda, Vato Falman, and Kain Fuery. While Mustang has a close and amicable relationship with all of his subordinates, he appears to share a deeper bond of affection with his second-in-command Riza Hawkeye, who has devoted her life to supporting him. This bond culminates in the final episodes of the anime when Mustang chooses Hawkeye alone to accompany him on his greatest and most dangerous mission.   Though a hero of the Ishval War, he remains haunted by the horrors of war and suffers great remorse for the lives he took.   Roy Mustang is the \"Flame Alchemist\", having absolute control over heat and fire through alchemy. Using special gloves that create a spark when he snaps his fingers, Roy can create anything from a tiny ember to burn a letter, to a raging inferno that can destroy a humanoid body in seconds. His precise control over the alchemically enhanced flame is so accurate that he can boil the water in a persons' eyes and can also attack enemies amongst a riot without hurting any allies.   After the Promised Day arrives, he is forced to open the gate by Pride and Wrath, they first try to make him do it voluntarily by reviving Hawkeye, but he refuses. So Pride opens the gate for him using his Philosopher's Stone. Mustang gains the power to transmute without a circle, however,\u200b his price is his eyesight.

Makarov shows extreme dislike for the Council and all the rules they try to impose on guilds. He frequently attempts to balance reprimands from the council and the eccentricity of his guild. He encourages Fairy Tail to do what they feel is right, but he has shown some concern that Natsu, Ezra, and Gray will someday level a whole town. His magical abilities include Titan magic, giving him the ability to grow his body parts gigantic and his body into a giant sized version of himself, and can control various other forms of magic including fire, ice and wind, which give him an immense magical power. The members of his guild affectionately refer to him as Ji-san or grandpa. Makarov also sees all of his guild members as his own children and will do anything to protect them. He has a perverted side, shown when he states he wishes to be smashed by Lucy's breasts and subsequently spanks her many times as a punishment.  When the Fairy Tail guild building was attacked by Phantom Lord, he didn't seem to care and shrugged off the situation, noting that Guild wars are forbidden. However, after the Shadow Gear team was ambushed in the night by Phantom Lord and crucified to a tree, he leads a full frontal attack against Phantom Lord. However, Makarov, distracted and upset, is ambushed by Aria from Phantom Lord, causing him to lose his magic and forcing the Fairy Tail guild to retreat. Erza noted that they wouldn't be able to defeat Jose without Makarov, and Polyushko noted that Makarov didn't think over the attack and rushed into things without considering his age, calling him a fool for acting this way. After recovering, Makarov returns and defeated Jose with his \"Fairy Law,\" a powerful spell that only defeats those he considers his enemy. Afterwards, Aria attempts to attack him again, but Makarov easily dispatches him, showing Aria's previous victory was a fluke due to Makarov losing his focus.  Given his advanced age, he considers retirement, but considers Luxus as too uncaring, Gildartz impossible for some unknown reason, Mist Gun as too reclusive, and Erza as too young and brash to succeed him as guild master. After hearing the damages made by the team Erza-Lucy-Grey-Natsu-Happy from Mirajane, he cried that it's impossible to retire by now.

Her most distinctive features are her very large breasts, which are even larger than Orihime Inoue's. She also shares Orihime's strange taste in food. She dresses in the garb typical of shinigami, though her robes hang loose enough for her ample bosom to be revealed. She wears a necklace and a pink scarf over her shoulders. In addition, her lieutenant's armband is worn on her uniform's sash, as opposed to around the arm.  Rangiku tends to be a slacker who doesn't like paperwork and loves to drink sak\u00e9. She's not the least bit modest about her appearance, frequently referring or complaining about her large breasts in casual conversation. She even tries to bribe Ichigo Kurosaki into letting her stay at his house using them, though unsuccessfully. Her easy-going and free-spirited personality is in sharp contrast with the serious Hitsugaya, but the two seem to be quite close, regardless. Rangiku is almost constantly by his side and has shown her loyalty to him on several occasions. While she seems somewhat self-centered, she is sensitive to the feelings of others, evident when she sees the concern Hitsugaya has for Momo Hinamori, the guilt Izuru Kira shares with her when Gin Ichimaru is revealed as a traitor, and when Orihime feels depressed about her role in Ichigo Kurosaki's life. Despite her lackadaisical image, she can be extremely serious when needed. She's shown to be somewhat maternal, especially with Orihime and Momo.   Not much is mentioned about Rangiku's past. She came from Rukongai and was rescued as a child by Gin Ichimaru; the two soon became friends. In one short chapter from the manga, she was once asked by Ichimaru during her childhood when her birthday was. She replied that she did not know because she had been alone for as far as she could remember. This possibly means she was orphaned since birth. When he heard about this, Ichimaru told her that if this was the case, then her birthday should be set on the day they met (the day she was not alone anymore).  It is not known how she became a shinigami or how she became lieutenant of the 10th Division, but it is known that she has held the position longer than her current captain has held his. She first met Hitsugaya in Rukongai when the two bumped into one-another. Recognizing his immense power, and the harm it was causing to the old woman he lived with, she convinced him to become a shinigami in order to control it.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","Image":"https:\/\/s4.anilist.co\/file\/anilistcdn\/character\/large\/904.jpg"},{"Quote":"The true measure of a shinobi is not how he lives but how he dies.

Run, run and cling to life._   \n\n~~~ __ _Background___~~~  Itachi Uchiha is a missing-nin from Konohagakure, and a prominent member of Akatsuki, partnered with Kisame Hoshigaki. He is Sasuke Uchiha's older brother.   Itachi is relatively popular among many fans of Naruto, often having ranked in the top ten in Shonen Jump magazine's popularity polls since his introduction. He was first ranked in the third character popularity poll ranked in 11th place. He was ranked 9th place during the fourth popularity poll, and 6th place in the fifth popularity poll. During the sixth popularity poll, he again was ranked in 11th place. In the last poll, he was ranked in 5th place.  Itachi was born into the Uchiha clan and was praised by all as the best of his generation - a genius above all others. Even by the standards of the battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi's prowess far outshined all others. However, not even his family, friends, or teachers could understand him. When he was only 4, Itachi had already witnessed countless lives lost due to the Third Great Shinobi World War, which emotionally traumatized him and turned him into a pacifist. At age 7, he graduated from the Ninja Academy at the top of his class after only one year, mastered the Sharingan at age 8, passed the Chunin Exams at age 10, and became ANBU Captain at age 13. According to Madara Uchiha, Itachi also had a lover, whom he killed during the Uchiha clan massacre.  He was praised highly by his father, who saw the family's future in Itachi, hence neglecting his other son - Itachi's younger brother, Sasuke. However, during this time Itachi showed great affection towards his little brother, Sasuke, and even encouraged his father to come to the Academy when Sasuke was enrolled, something their dad had otherwise forgotten, by saying that he would not go to an important mission, that would establish Itachi a place in the ANBU ranks, otherwise.   When the Uchiha began planning to overthrow Konoha, Itachi, as an ANBU, was tasked with spying on the village. Knowing that a coup d'etat would only lead to another Ninja War, Itachi chose to spy on the Uchiha instead, passing on information to the Third Hokage and the other Konoha elders. After this he began to act strangely, not attending the clan meetings, speaking out against the clan, and becoming the prime suspect for the murder of his best friend, Shisui Uchiha. The clan lost hope in Itachi, and his father began shifting his focus to Sasuke instead. Meanwhile, the Third's attempts to negotiate a bloodless end to hostilities between the two parties were proving ineffective, so, against the Third's wishes, Danzo and the Konoha Council ordered Itachi to wipe out the Uchiha.  Before the fateful night arrived, Itachi discovered the existence of Madara Uchiha, who was attempting to rekindle the flames of war in Konoha. In return for not attacking Konoha, Itachi offered to help Madara claim vengeance against the Uchiha for turning their backs on him decades earlier. Madara agreed. Itachi slaughtered his entire clan overnight, sparing only Sasuke. Sasuke's life was worth more than the village to Itachi, and he could not follow through with the orders to kill him as well. Instead, he made himself out as a villain, who had killed their innocent family only to test his abilities. By doing so, he wanted Sasuke to take vengeance on him and become a hero to Konoha, thus redeeming the Uchiha name. He tortured Sasuke with his Mangekyo Sharingan, and encouraged him to become strong enough to kill him and avenge their family. Hoping that his beloved little brother would someday be powerful enough to kill him, Itachi left the village as a traitor.  Knowing that Konoha would still want to eliminate Sasuke, Itachi pleaded with the Third Hokage to keep Sasuke safe. He also threatened Danzo to not harm Sasuke or risk him revealing everything he knew about Konoha's secrets to enemy countries. Sasuke's safety was therefore secured, and Itachi returned to his original plan of becoming infamous for his slaughter of the Uchiha.   Itachi joined Akatsuki in order to keep an eye on the organization, along with Madara Uchiha, in case either ever acted against Konoha, all the while planning for his death at Sasuke's hands. While a member of Akatsuki, Itachi was approached by Orochimaru, who tried to steal his body to gain the Sharingan. Itachi trapped him in a genjutsu and severed his left hand as punishment, forcing Orochimaru to flee the organization. Sometime after joining Akatsuki, Itachi later helped recruit Deidara, Orochimaru's replacement, by beating him in battle, after which Deidara swore vengeance again.   \n\n~~~ __ _Personality___~~~  Ever since his first appearance, Itachi had always been mysterious, and had acted as though he was hiding his true self. While flashbacks to his past showed that he was a compassionate brother and person, his later acts and claims made it seem that this was mostly just an act. But, surprisingly, he genuinely was the compassionate brother he had once claimed to be, although he hid this from the rest of the Akatsuki to protect Sasuke.  As a member of Akatsuki, he possessed incredible self-control of his emotions. He constantly displayed an emotionless personality. He only showed surprise when opponents proved more powerful or skilled than he had expected, and even then he didn't lose his composure. He did not possess any arrogance, and fully justified any statements he made about his power, even complimenting his opponents at times on their abilities.  In addition to being an extremely powerful ninja, Itachi had equally impressive intelligence, and was shown to be very wise. He was exceedingly sharp and observant to any situation at hand, as he was rarely surprised or caught off guard. He also displayed great intuition, as he was almost never deceived and even then almost instantly realized the truth. Despite his status as a wanted criminal, and having murdered a significant portion of his family, Itachi took no enjoyment in violence or combat, instead preferring to avoid battle or, if this was not possible, end it as quickly as he could.  Itachi's only initial interest was in Akatsuki's goals, and his only loyalties appeared to be to the organization and its members, seeming to put the organization's success and secrecy before everything else.As such, Itachi got along with his partner, Kisame, much better than most other Akatsuki members did with their own partners. Kisame appeared to have a deep loyalty to Itachi, immediately doing as he instructed and constantly looking out for his well-being. Itachi treated all of his fellow Akatsuki members to this same, more respectful personality, although his courtesy was rarely returned by the other members.  However, when he was in a genjutsu duel during his fight with Sasuke, he cruelly claimed he had only let Sasuke live so that he could take Sasuke's eyes and obtain his own Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, after which he then claimed the Uchiha clan had been nothing but tainted and evil, since many members would kill their friends to gain the Mangekyo Sharingan, and would take another Uchiha's eyes to make its power permanent. Once the genjutsu was released, he called it his true self, implying his calm, emotionless personality was also a facade. This persona was later revealed to be only an act to ensure that he would die by Sasuke's hands, his love for his younger brother being the fundamental aspect of his personality.   Despite his status as an infamous shinobi, his appearance was not the most intimidating, apart from the intensity of his eyes. While living in Konoha, he would regularly have a gentle and caring look in his eyes, especially directed towards his younger brother. After joining Akatsuki, he would regularly have a stern look to them. He was a fairly tall shinobi, whose basic appearance was very much like the rest of his clan.  He, like all members of his clan, possessed dark grey eyes, and also had black hair that hung near his cheeks to frame his face. He also had the addition of a long ponytail in the back of his hair (which he obscured with his Akatsuki cloak after joining the organization). Being brothers, Itachi and Sasuke had a similar appearance, but with subtle differences. Itachi's hair color appeared slightly duller and with a softer flow to it, without the spiky style at the back. His skin was also slightly darker. Itachi's most distinguishing characteristics were the long pronounced creases under his eyes.  When he lived in Konoha, his casual clothes would consist of a black shirt with a large Uchiha clan symbol on the back of it, and black pants with a weapons pouch strapped to them. When on duty, he would wear the traditional ANBU uniform, although he was never shown wearing a mask. As a member of Akatsuki, he wore the traditional Akatsuki cloak, and usually kept the center of it buttoned down. After his cloak was incinerated by Sasuke's Kirin during their fight in Part II, it was revealed that he still wore his casual clothes underneath it. Like almost all members of Akatsuki, he wore the headband of his home village, Konoha, with a line gouged through it, to symbolize his broken ties with the village (although, secretly, he was actually still loyal to his village).    \n\n~~~ __ _Abilities___~~~  Since a young age, Itachi's intellect and talent showed their brilliance in everything he did, as even his teachers said his progress hardly required any help. In the few battles he had been seen in since the start of the series, Itachi was shown to be an incredibly powerful ninja, and easily one of the strongest in the Naruto series, as demonstrated by his ability to easily defeat Deidara, Sasuke, Kakashi Hatake, Kurenai Yuhi and Orochimaru (twice), who themselves are considered amongst the strongest ninjas in Naruto. Being a pacifist, Itachi did not actively take part in battle, typically only acting in self-defense.   \n\n~~~ __ _Sharingan___~~~  Being of the Uchiha Clan, and as noted by Kakashi, Itachi was a true successor of the Sharingan Eye. From a stationary position, he would study an opponent's movements with his Sharingan and respond accordingly, often with a genjutsu. He could cast a genjutsu by merely pointing at or looking at someone, and could similarly turn an opponent's genjutsu against them with Demonic Illusion: Mirror Heaven and Earth Change. Itachi had trained so much with his eyes that he had reached the stage where he could have his Sharingan activated the entire time, with minimal drain on his chakra levels.    \n\n~~~ __ _Mangekyo Sharingan___~~~  Itachi possessed the Mangekyo Sharingan, which increased his already great power, and enabled him to use his most powerful techniques. With his left eye, he could use Tsukuyomi, a genjutsu that traps an opponent's mind in an illusionary world, torturing them for what seems like days in a matter of seconds.With his right eye he could use Amaterasu, a ninjutsu which allowed him to create a black flame that he could direct by moving his eye to burn through seemingly anything in its path, including fire itself. His final technique was Susanoo, a technique that manifested itself as a spectral being, labelled as the \"Raging God of Battle\" in the databook. It wielded the Totsuka Sword, an ethereal sword with the ability to seal anything it pierces into the gourd that serves as its hilt, and Yata's Mirror, a shield that can reflect any attack. Zetsu, a fellow Akatsuki member, stated that Itachi's mastery of the Sharingan, combined with the legendary weapons of Susanoo, made him invincible.   Despite his mastery of the Mangekyo Sharingan, Itachi suffered greatly from its side effects. His eyesight would worsen after every activation of the Mangekyo Sharingan, and he would eventually go blind from its power, with his Sharingan forever sealed away. Itachi was so close to blindness that, by the time he activated Susanoo in his final fight, both Sharingan eyes had become almost blind, and had turned white. However, he was still able to perform his own F\u016binjutsu in his last moments.\n \n(Sources: Naruto.com and Naruto.wikia.com )","Image":"https:\/\/s4.anilist.co\/file\/anilistcdn\/character\/large\/n14-jr5pH4YLWDke.jpg"},{"Quote":"A castle that vanishes at the first gust of wind is worthless.

At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightfoward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.  \n\n Luffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young male hero\/adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial \"D\".  \n\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear towards his grandfather, to the point that he does not fight back and is intimidated at the mere mention of him.  \n\nLuffy never kills any of the villains, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or until the point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.  \n\nLuffy's dream is to find the One Piece and become Pirate King. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks.   \n\nMonkey D. Dragon is the father of Monkey D. Luffy and is also the son of Vice-Admiral Monkey D. Garp. Known as the Revolutionary Dragon, he is the world's most wanted criminal.  Before the start of the series, Dragon left Luffy in Garp's care. Dragon first appears after a lightning bolt suddenly destroys the gallows where Luffy was to be executed by Buggy the Clown and then saves Luffy from being captured by Captain Smoker. When he saved Luffy from Smoker, a mighty gust of eerie wind swept through Loguetown. It is undetermined whether or not he was the cause behind the gust of wind or the lightning; however, the story leads to believe there is more to him than it seems. Recently, he has taken over an island in the South Blue and is about to head to the North Blue when he commented, after noticing Luffy's newest bounty, given to him after invading Enies Lobby, that father and son will meet sometime soon.","Image":"https:\/\/s4.anilist.co\/file\/anilistcdn\/character\/large\/b40-NKxeBrrS2vp4.png"},{"Quote":"Hard work betrays none, but dreams betray many.

He is frequently absent in the guild due to the nature of the requests he receives. He is widely referred by members of the Fairy Tail Guilds as \"that geezer\". His back shows a man with spikey hair, wearing a tattered cloak. His infamy as a mage was also commented upon by the Guild Master of Phantom Lord, Jose Porla: \"...

He is rumoured to have taken both a 10-year-job as well as a 100-year-job, which is classified above the SS rank jobs as the difficulty is ranked on how long it would take for completion. His long-term periodic absences may be the reason for Makarov's decision for dropping Gildarts out of equation as his successor, and why no attempt of communication was made during the Phantom-Fairy Tail War.    He also seems to be an incredibly popular and important mage throughout the town as well, as his impending arrival is subject to a large bell being rung in a \"special manner\" to notify people of his coming. Also the Fairy Tail mages seem to burst into celebration as a reaction to his arrival, indicating that unlike Mystogan who is virtually unknown and Laxus who was generally disliked due to his attitude, he is extremely well liked by the town and everyone at Fairy Tail.

Erza, is a tall, beautiful girl with long red hair, and brown eyes. She is almost always wearing an armored suit, made by Heart Kreuz. However, thanks to her requip magic, she can wear many magic armors, and can even requip swim suits, and clothes for recreational purposes. Her member stamp is on her left shoulder.  Erza is a very strict person, often criticizing the bad behavior and habits of the other guild members, causing most them to apologize for fear that they might invoke her wrath. She is also impatient, liking people who answer her questions quickly as seen when she promptly knocks out anyone who doesn't answer her questions (despite them not knowing anything). Also, Erza has a problem where she apparently sees everyone as guild members (best seen when she asks civilians to take things places during a mission). However, she has a great sense of justice. Despite being a very strict person, she seems to have a clumsy side to her as seen during the Galuna arc when she fell into a pit hole.  Like most Fairy Tail members, she shows great loyalty and dedication to Makarov and the guild. She pushed herself past her limit in the war against the Phantom Lord Guild, fighting against its many powerful members. She also became the temporary leader when Makarov had to be treated because of his scattered magic.  Although it hasn't been fully explored, it is implied that Natsu Dragneel, Erza and Gray Fullbuster are all very close to each other. While staying over at Lucy's house, Erza revealed that the three of them used to take showers together. It is later revealed that Erza, Natsu, and Gray have all been part of Fairy Tail ever since they were children.   Erza used to be a child slave where she was forced to help build a tower called the R-system. Over time Erza made friends with other slaves, among them was G\u00e9rard. When she and the other slaves tried to rebel, the evil magicians overwhelmed the slaves, but it was then when Erza's magic awakens and kills them all, setting them free from slavery.A cult tried to build this tower to resurrect Zeref.

At first prevailing, mages start to show up and they begin to lose. A magic blast comes towards Erza, but Rob interferes, saving Erza, but killing him. She gets very angry triggering her magic. She controls all the swords around her and wins the battle for everyone. When everyone is on the boat to go home, Erza goes back in the dungeons to look for Gerard. Already possessed by Zeref, Gerard attacks Erza and tells her he is going to complete the R-System to resurrect Zeref's body. He tells her not to tell anybody about the tower or he will kill everyone. She then wakes up on an island crying about the events just witnessed.  After Erza escapes from the island of slaves, she tries to find Fairy Tail. She had heard about Fairy Tail from an old man named Rob, another slave that was forced to work on the R-system, he also cared for her like a grandpa. Eight years prior to the beginning of the story, she found Fairy Tail and taken in as a member. Upon joining, Erza immediately developed a habit to wear armour, as it made her feel safe.

His original name was Shinta (\u5fc3\u592a). \n\nHis parents died of cholera when he was very young and as a result, was adopted by three slave women in a traveling slave wagon. Soon after meeting them, bandits had raided the convoy and killed his three new guardians and where about to kill him when Seijuro Hiko killed the bandits. Hiko soon adopted the child and because Shinta was not a name fitted for a swordman, he renamed him Kenshin, meaning \"Heart of Sword,\" took him under his wing and taught him the Hiten Mitsuruugi Ryu.   \n\n However, before full completion of the sword style could be passed on to Kenshin, the Japanese Revolution had been happening at the time and right before Kenshin's eyes.  Because of his kind nature and seeing people suffering, he knew he needed to do something about it.  He left in the middle of his training and without his master's blessing and joined the Imperialists.  It was during the Revolution where Kenshin met Tomoe, his first love and wife. During the revolution, Kenshin was given the nickname of Hitokiri Battousai because of his god-like speed of drawing a sword to kill the enemy instantly. After helping the Imperialist to a position where they would undoubtedly win the revolution, Kenshin left the revolution all-together with a vow to never kill again and the reverse-blade sword handed to him by Shakku-dono. It was Tomoe's death by his hands that pushed him over the edge of never to kill again.\n\nThe next time we see Kenshin is 10 years later as he has become a wanderer who helps out anyone in need who is suffering right before his eyes. Those long 10 years have taken him from Kyoto, all over Japan to where we find him in episode one of the anime, in Tokyo, still keeping his vow never to kill again. It is here where he meets Kaoru Kamiya and his whole life begins to change once again.\n\nKenshin is usually depicted as a care-free swordsman who is very aloof and tends to be a bit simple-minded when it comes to living normally. He is seen to be doing many of the chores around the dojo that he stays at with Kaoru, (i.e., cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc.). He believes it is his way of repaying Kaoru with allowing him to stay at her dojo. (although it seems he has gotten attracted to kaoru in the end). However, his swordsmanship ranks among the elite as he is seen defeating every rival (with the exception of Hajime Saitou which ended in a draw).

In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage and leader of the Hidden Leaf Village sealed the demon fox within Naruto's newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.  Despite the Fourth Hokage's dying wish that Naruto be viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a  _Jinchuuriki_) the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demon were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracised by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbour a fierce hatred for Naruto.  Naruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village.

To be perfect is to be unable to improve any further. ","Author":"Kurotsuchi Mayuri","Summary":"Date of birth: March 20th Zodiac sign: Pisces Height: 174 cm (5'8\u00bd\"). Weight: 54kg (119 lbs.) Occupation: 12th Division Captain, Vice-President of the Shinigami Research and Development Institute  Mayuri Kurotsuchi is Captain of the 12th Division in the Gotei 13 and 2nd president of the Shinigami Research Institute. He gained his position after Kisuke Urahara, the former captain and president, was sentenced into exile by Soul Society. His lieutenant is Nemu Kurotsuchi, his artificially-created \"daughter\".    __Appearance__   Mayuri's appearance has a very skeletal look to it with a skull-like visage. His fingernails are blue and, with the exception of the fingernail on his right middle finger, are all short. The one long fingernail is as long as the finger itself. In the anime, Mayuri is revealed to have blue hair and yellow eyes when unmasked. He also wears a white hat with two ends that point to his right and a large purple scarf around his neck. He repaints his make-up every morning, as he always removes it before going to bed.    __Extension Arm:__ Mayuri's left arm can extend out like a grappling hook.    __Hidden Kusarigama:__ Mayuri is able to pull out part of his ear, which is Scythe like weapon attached to his body.    __Camouflage:__ He is able to blend himself with the environment with some sort of covering that flakes away once he reveals himself.     __Personality__   Mayuri Kurotsuchi is a researcher and personifies the stereotype of the mad scientist. By his early actions during the Ryoka Invasion, he is displayed as one of the most sadistic and cruel Shinigami. He sees everyone and everything not as a living being, but as an object to be researched\u2014including himself. He has little respect or regard for most others, and was even willing to turn his own men (who were not aware of his plans) into human bombs in an attempt to capture Ury\u016b Ishida and Orihime Inoue for experimentation. He also withheld vital information about the Bount from the other Shinigami in order to capture one as a research subject for himself.   It is known that Mayuri's favorite food is pike fish, while he does not like onion. One of his free-time activities is reading every character published in Seiretei Communication. He himself publishes a serialization in the journal, titled \"Effective Medication for the Brain\", which apparently contains detailed instructions on preparation of medicine and their application. Surprisingly it is highly popular among the readers.   In battle Mayuri likes to play with his opponent torturing little by little until they can hardly stand.    __History__   Little is known about the early history of Mayuri, except that he was the only prisoner in the Maggot's Nest who was considered dangerous enough to necessitate confinement in a small prison cell, chained to the wall by his ankle. He was removed from confinement at the Maggot's Nest was requested by Kisuke Urahara to become vice-captain to the newly thought of Research and Development Institute. Nine years later he became the third seat of the 12th Division. He later succeeded Kisuke Urahara in leading the Research and Development Institute as well as becoming captain of the 12th Division of the Gotei 13. He also experimented on Quincy, including S\u014dken Ishida, Ury\u016b's master and grandfather, in his studies. He believed that upon S\u014dken Ishida's death the Quincy had been entirely wiped out, and was disappointed to learn that Ury\u016b was a Quincy because he considered his study of the Quincy complete and did not want any further Quincy specimens.    __Abilities__   __Master Scientist\/Inventor: __As the head of the Shinigami Research Institute, Mayuri is a talented inventor and scientist, having created a number of devices or techniques to aid him in battle or otherwise. As well Mayuri is a mad scientist embodied, he has no morals or empathy in everyday life and apparently his work is devoid of it as well, he will go to any length he feels is necessary to achieve his goals. He often takes no interest in issues of Soul Society and will rather engage in his research, unless personally requested by the General Yamamoto.    __Master Strategist:__ Mayuri has a talent for being well prepared. He takes various precautions before engaging in personal combat with an adversary, usually studying them through his various methods in order to gain a clear advantage. He seems to always have a contingency plan if something doesn't work out the way he expects.    __Body Modification:__ It is implied that Mayuri has done extensive research on modifying bodies, and he has upgraded a variety of his own body parts to function as weapons or otherwise provide him with useful abilities. His left arm can extend like a grappling hook, and he is able to pull part of his ear out of his head to form a scythe attached to a rope-like ligament for use as a kusarigama. He can also blend into his environment with the aid of a topical camouflage which flakes away after he reveals himself. More impressively, he has demonstrated the ability to replace functional internal organs with false ones, a feat he performs on himself and his lieutenant to safeguard them from injury. This particular operation is conceived of and carried out in the span of less than an hour.    __Master Chemist:__ Mayuri has otherwise been shown to be an adept chemist, manufacturing a drug that can slow down a person's perception of time. It is able to make one second seem like 100 years for the unfortunate victim to whom it is administered. An undiluted dose of the drug causes the senses to speed up trillions of times while the relatively \"slow\" body fails to keep up, resulting in paralysis; on the other hand, it is implied that a diluted dose of the drug can greatly enhance the user's reaction speed. Mayuri has also developed a \"regenerative serum,\" which can regrow limbs upon injection.    __Environment Melding Technique:__ Another one of Mayuri's abilities likely achieved scientifically is his ability to meld with the color and texture of the environment.    __Flash Steps Expert__    __Zanpaktou__   Ashisogi Jiz\u014d (\u758b\u6bba\u5730\u8535; Leg-Cutting Jiz\u014d): Ksitigarbha is a bodhisattva that watches over children and the underworld. In Japan, where he is known as Jiz\u014d, he looks rather like a baby dressed as a Buddhist monk; Mayuri's Zanpakut\u014d has what looks like a giant baby's head on it. Its hilt is wrapped in cloth, and has several spiky protrusions sticking out right below the blade, which appear to resemble leaves. Unlike most Shinigami, his Zanpakut\u014d's sheath hangs directly in front of him, instead of to his side as they are commonly worn.    __Shikai__   __Ashisogi Jiz\u014d's Shikai command is \"Rip\" (\u63bb\u304d\u6bdf\u308c, kakimushire)__. In its Shikai, Ashisogi Jiz\u014d transforms into a deformed trident with curved, serpentine blades and a guard shaped like a baby's head (as Ksitigarbha is depicted), all mounted on his sword's normal hilt.    __Shikai Special Ability:__ The baby's mouth secretes a poisonous vapor in this form. The weapon works like the venom of a spider bite; when an opponent is stabbed by Ashisogi Jiz\u014d, it severs the brain signals controlling the neural impulses for movement in the limb's of the victim, regardless of where they were struck. Unlike regular paralysis, the pain receptors and nerve endings are unaffected by the weapon, so the victim can still feel pain, even in a paralyzed limb. During the Bount arc, it is shown that healing the stab wound does not immediately remove the inflicted paralysis.    __Bankai__    __Konjiki Ashisogi Jiz\u014d (\u91d1\u8272\u758b\u6bba\u5730\u8535; Golden Leg-Cutting Jiz\u014d):__ returns Mayuri's Zanpakut\u014d to its sealed state and produces a giant caterpillar in a red cape with a grotesque baby's head and a silver halo.   Mayuri's Bankai, Konjiki Ashisogi Jiz\u014d  Mayuri's Bankai, Konjiki Ashisogi Jiz\u014d    __Bankai Special Ability:__ The creature breathes a poisonous derivative of Mayuri's blood which is lethal to anyone who breathes it, aside from Mayuri and Nemu. Numerous blades can also extend from its chest, allowing it to run through and skewer opponents. Only Mayuri has a cure for its poison, though Nemu usually carries it around. Mayuri can change the composition of the poison, as well, ensuring that no foolproof antidote can ever be manufactured to cure it, and no immunity developed against it. Mayuri has physically modified Konjiki Ashisogi Jiz\u014d itself so that it will self-destruct and return to its sealed state if it were to attack him, implying that it is sentient as well as organic, reminiscent of Captain Retsu Unohana's Minazuki.   Mayuri's Zanpakut\u014d also has the ability to transform Mayuri into a liquid when he stabs himself with its blade. Doing so doesn't kill him, but instead simply leaves him unable to attack or be attacked, making it an effective escape tool. He reforms after a few days. It's uncertain whether this ability is entirely the product of Ashisogi Jiz\u014d, since he specifically relates the ability to himself, not opponents. His various physical modifications may have something to do with the effect.

Erza, is a tall, beautiful girl with long red hair, and brown eyes. She is almost always wearing an armored suit, made by Heart Kreuz. However, thanks to her requip magic, she can wear many magic armors, and can even requip swim suits, and clothes for recreational purposes. Her member stamp is on her left shoulder.  Erza is a very strict person, often criticizing the bad behavior and habits of the other guild members, causing most them to apologize for fear that they might invoke her wrath. She is also impatient, liking people who answer her questions quickly as seen when she promptly knocks out anyone who doesn't answer her questions (despite them not knowing anything). Also, Erza has a problem where she apparently sees everyone as guild members (best seen when she asks civilians to take things places during a mission). However, she has a great sense of justice. Despite being a very strict person, she seems to have a clumsy side to her as seen during the Galuna arc when she fell into a pit hole.  Like most Fairy Tail members, she shows great loyalty and dedication to Makarov and the guild. She pushed herself past her limit in the war against the Phantom Lord Guild, fighting against its many powerful members. She also became the temporary leader when Makarov had to be treated because of his scattered magic.  Although it hasn't been fully explored, it is implied that Natsu Dragneel, Erza and Gray Fullbuster are all very close to each other. While staying over at Lucy's house, Erza revealed that the three of them used to take showers together. It is later revealed that Erza, Natsu, and Gray have all been part of Fairy Tail ever since they were children.   Erza used to be a child slave where she was forced to help build a tower called the R-system. Over time Erza made friends with other slaves, among them was G\u00e9rard. When she and the other slaves tried to rebel, the evil magicians overwhelmed the slaves, but it was then when Erza's magic awakens and kills them all, setting them free from slavery.A cult tried to build this tower to resurrect Zeref.

Already possessed by Zeref, Gerard attacks Erza and tells her he is going to complete the R-System to resurrect Zeref's body. He tells her not to tell anybody about the tower or he will kill everyone. She then wakes up on an island crying about the events just witnessed.  After Erza escapes from the island of slaves, she tries to find Fairy Tail. She had heard about Fairy Tail from an old man named Rob, another slave that was forced to work on the R-system, he also cared for her like a grandpa. Eight years prior to the beginning of the story, she found Fairy Tail and taken in as a member. Upon joining, Erza immediately developed a habit to wear armour, as it made her feel safe. It was around that time when Makarov took her to Porlyusica to get a artificial eye to replace her right eye that had became blind because of an injury.

He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed's primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a \"hero of the people\" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn't seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al's suffering.\n\nEdward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4'11\"), however his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed's ability to fight is not impaired, and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.\n\nBorn to Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim of Resembool in the winter of 1899, Edward's first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad's formative years, Ed was left with his mother and younger brother Alphonse as his only family. The three Elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Even while mourning, mired in grief, Edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dear mother back to life with the power of alchemy.\n\nEdward and Alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the Elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. Although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. In a stroke of good fortune, Resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the Elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. After they do, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi's intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool. \n\nThough instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the \"One is All, All is One\" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics to a forbidden practice called Human Transmutation.\n\nDevising a Human Transmutation Circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the Human Transmutation in their home. Unfortunately, the Human Transmutation resulted in a Rebound.\n\nAlphonse and Edward were pulled into The Gate. Encountering the mysterious being called Truth, Edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into God's domain and peeking at the Gate's vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. Maimed and bleeding, Edward was returned to the human dimension to find that Alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the Gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the Gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a Transmutation Circle - in the same style used by Izumi. Desperate to at least have his brother by his side, Edward willfully performed another Human Transmutation to call him back, this time sacrificing his right arm in exchange for Al's soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a Blood Rune before passing out from severe blood loss. Alphonse carried Ed to the Rockbell house, where a shocked Pinako and Winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy's life.\n\nOn the night of the failed transmutation. Lt. Colonel Flame alchemist Roy mustang came to the Rockbell's in res ponce to a letter that Edward and Alphonse had sent him in the mail asking about their Father. He was shocked at the fact that the two boys had tried human alchemy and survived, and informed them that they could become state alchemist and maybe one day find a way to return their bodies to the way they were. Desperate to get His younger brother's body back, Edward asked the Rockbells to give him prosthetic limbs called automale. Though they warned him the surgery would be painful, he said the pain was nothing compared to what his brother had given up. He only took a year to adapt to the automale at age 11 when it took most adults 3 years.","Image":"https:\/\/s4.anilist.co\/file\/anilistcdn\/character\/large\/n11-k3dR0ZXPTwLd.jpg"},{"Quote":"Religion, ideology, resources, land, spite, love or just because\u2026 No matter how pathetic the reason, it\u2019s enough to start a war.

Luffy  \n__Age:__ 17; 19  \n__Birthdate:__ May 5, Taurus  \n__Height:__ 172 cm (5'7\u00bd\"); 174 cm (5'8\u00bd\")\n__Blood Type:__ F  \n__Affiliation:__ Straw Hat Pirates, ASL brothers, Straw Hat Grand Fleet, Straw Hat alliance: Heart Pirates (current); Dadan Family (former)\n__Position:__ Captain\n__Devil Fruit:__Gomu Gomu no Mi (Gum Gum Fruit)\n__Devil Fruit Type:__Paramecia\n__Bounty:__  1,500,000,000 Beli (previously; 30,000,000, 100,000,000, 300,000,000, 400,000,000 and 500,000,000)  \n\nLuffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and is best friends with all of them and values them over all else. At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightfoward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.  \n\n Luffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young male hero\/adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial \"D\".  \n\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear towards his grandfather, to the point that he does not fight back and is intimidated at the mere mention of him.  \n\nLuffy never kills any of the villains, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or until the point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.  \n\nLuffy's dream is to find the One Piece and become Pirate King. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks.   \n\nMonkey D. Dragon is the father of Monkey D. Luffy and is also the son of Vice-Admiral Monkey D. Garp. Known as the Revolutionary Dragon, he is the world's most wanted criminal.  Before the start of the series, Dragon left Luffy in Garp's care. Dragon first appears after a lightning bolt suddenly destroys the gallows where Luffy was to be executed by Buggy the Clown and then saves Luffy from being captured by Captain Smoker. When he saved Luffy from Smoker, a mighty gust of eerie wind swept through Loguetown. It is undetermined whether or not he was the cause behind the gust of wind or the lightning; however, the story leads to believe there is more to him than it seems. Recently, he has taken over an island in the South Blue and is about to head to the North Blue when he commented, after noticing Luffy's newest bounty, given to him after invading Enies Lobby, that father and son will meet sometime soon.","Image":"https:\/\/s4.anilist.co\/file\/anilistcdn\/character\/large\/b40-NKxeBrrS2vp4.png"},{"Quote":"Even if I die, you keep living okay?

He never shows his face to the world, instead representing himself with a capital L in Cloister Black font. After meeting the Kira investigation team, he requests that the task force refer to him as Ryuzaki for discretion. The Kira investigation team never learns his true name. Ohba said that L is the smartest character in the manga because \"the plot requires it.\" Ohba also said that he personally views L as \"slightly evil\"; for instance, in chapter 109, Near discloses the fact that L claimed to pursue cases out of personal interest with no great sense of justice. When asked about L's nationality, Ohba responded saying \"I think of him as a quarter Japanese, a quarter English, a quarter Russian and... maybe a quarter French or Italian? Something like that.\" Tom S. Peperium of IGN described L's voice in the English anime version as \"low monotone, while inspired by the original Japanese actor, sounds like a man deep in thought, a master detective on the hunt.\" Ohba said that his favorite human character in the series was L as Ohba believed that L was the \"strongest\" character in the series \"besides Light.\" Obata chose L as his favorite due to \"appearance, personality, everything.\" Obata said that he could never have created L and that he enjoyed drawing L. Obata added that because of this, L is not \"real\" to him and therefore he likes that aspect of L. In response to the question \"Who was the most fun to draw?\" both Ohba and Obata answered \"L.\" L's disheveled and languid appearance masks his great powers of deduction and insight. He tends to second-guess everything he is presented with, and is extremely meticulous and analytical. He has several quirks such as preferring to crouch rather than sit, eating only sweet foods like desserts and fruits, and holding items very delicately. L stayed in England for five years, and during that time he was the champion in tennis for the England Junior Cup. L also secretly assumes the identities of the world's second and third best detectives, (Eraldo Coil and Deneuve respectively). In chapter 38 of the manga, L suggests that even though he eats only sweet foods, he remains underweight because the brain uses the most calories of any organ in the body. He also says that if he sits normally, his reasoning ability would drop 40%. Whenever L gives percentages to indicate how much he suspects a person of committing a crime, such as \"five percent,\" in reality he means over 90 percent. Although L gives Light a low percentage indicating how much he suspects Light, in reality L is \"pretty certain\" that Light is Kira. Ohba said about L, \"The truth is, he's a liar.\"","Image":"https:\/\/s4.anilist.co\/file\/anilistcdn\/character\/large\/b71-X7zsL6nWUDmf.png"},{"Quote":"I must study lots of things or I won\u2019t become a great person.

He exiled Erza from the island and took control of the construction of the Tower of Heaven in order to resurrect [Zeref](https:\/\/anilist.co\/character\/37720\/Zeref). He bombed the ship that was supposed to take the slaves off the island, and told them afterward that it was Erza's doing, as she had gone insane with her newfound Magic Powers. Believing that she had truly escaped on her own and thus betrayed them, the slaves helped him build the tower as a way of showing their gratitude for saving them from certain death. Eight years later Jellal had Erza kidnapped to be used as a sacrifice to revive Zeref. He convinces the Magic Council to try and destroy the tower in order to fuel the resurrection system. He destroys the Magic Council once their purpose is fulfilled and tries to fulfill his plans. Erza confronts him, but he defeats her and kills Simon, another childhood friend.

In the first season, after the incident with the time and space being unstable, Murata accidentally (or maybe purposefully?) drops by into the other world with Yuuri.

Soon after that, it's finally revealed that Murata is actually the reincarnation of the once Great Sage (or Daikenja) of Shin Makoku 4000 years ago.  His place was to guide Yuuri as King to regain the four forbidden boxes and defeat Soushu (which that time remained in Shinou's soul). In the end, he succeeded and Yuuri managed to did it, even though in order to make that plan successfully work, Murata had to 'pretend' to betray Yuuri and the others.  Murata is more like a babysitter figure towards Shinou, because of the time they had spent together in the past, and him being Shinou's most trusted strategist. Even so, he truly respects Shinou as a leader and even when he (Daikenja, 4000 years ago)'s dead and reincarnated into a different person, all he thinks about is how to defeat Soushu.  As the Great Sage, he is really bright and wise. He acts calm and never rushes to do anything. He relies on his brain and strategies. His power cannot stand alone, but he can amplify the Maou's power, and has lent Yuuri his powers when he needed it.

","Author":" Ichigo Kurosaki","Summary":" __Race:__ Human, Shinigami,  Visored, Fullbringer, Quincy  __Birthday:__ July 15th  \n__ Zodiac:__ Cancer   \n__Age:__ 15 (beginning) - 17 (currently)  \n__Gender:__ Male  \n__Height:__ 181 cm  \n__Weight:__ 66 kg  \n__Known Relatives:__ Isshin Kurosaki (father), Masaki Kurosaki (mother, deceased), Yuzu Kurosaki (younger sister), Karin Kurosaki (younger sister)  \n__Theme Songs:__ \"Number One\" by Hazel Fernandes, \"News From the Front\" by Bad Religion  \n\n\nFor the most part, Ichigo appears like a normal teenage boy, the one exception to that is his spiky, orange hair, a trait which he has been ridiculed about for years. He is a fairly tall, and lean-built person with peach skin and brown eyes. Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin. When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears standard Shinigami attire with the addition of a strap across his chest.  When he was young, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world. Ichigo always smiled whenever he was with Masaki and he was regularly at her side, holding her hand.  As a teenager, Ichigo's personality is much more complex. Stubborn, short-tempered, occasionally confrontational, determined, outspoken, strong-willed and impulsive, he attempts to maintain a detached and \"cool\" image, despite claiming to not care about what other people think about him. He generally keeps his face set in a permanent scowl with his eyebrows drawn together. Ichigo carries the burden of the real world and the spirit world (Soul Society), a task quite difficult, especially for a teenager like Ichigo, who has his own worries and problems. Also, Ichigo is quite smart; he was ranked 23rd in his high school. He does this partly to prove to his teachers and classmates that just because he's unique, or somewhat punkish, that he can still succeed.  When Ichigo first becomes a Shinigami, his Zanpakut\u014d is a standard-looking katana, but oversized with an equally-oversized brown sheathe hung by a strap over his right shoulder. It has a rectangular bronze hand guard with gently inward-curved edges, a stylized flame pattern on the long sides, and a simple decorative slit on the short ones. The handle is red with two light blue tassels on the end of the handle. The large size is due to the unfocused but immense amount of Ichigo's spiritual power, which he didn't know how to control. As a result, the sword itself was rather weak, since very little spiritual power was used to create it. Nevertheless, it was powerful enough to subdue a Gillian-class Menos and lesser Hollows, completely blocking a Cero from the former. It was even able to upturn the ground with a single strike. Because of its weak spiritual energy nature, Byakuya Kuchiki was able to easily cut off most of the blade during his first encounter with Ichigo and Kisuke Urahara subsequently slices it down to the hilt during their training, forcing Ichigo to learn the name of his Zanpakut\u014d in order to release its true form. This sword is found to be a result of Rukia's deprived spiritual energy and not a result of his own power.   Ichigo is an extremely rare case. Despite being a Shinigami, he is still a living Human being and resides in the Human World, rather than in Soul Society. Uniquely, he gained his own powers through Urahara's training\/forced encroachment, which simultaneously gave him Hollow powers. Due to his Hollow powers, Ichigo is technically classified as a Visored, but he still thinks and refers to himself as a Shinigami. For all purposes, Ichigo is a Human in physical body and Visored in spiritual body, thus making his situation even rarer. After losing his Shinigami powers Ichigo returns to being a human, this time with no spiritual power or spiritual awareness at all. His enormous spiritual power capacity was being Kurosaki Isshin's Offspring, letting him see ghosts and hollows from a very young age. It was revealed that he has access to Quincy powers, due to his mother.","Image":"https:\/\/s4.anilist.co\/file\/anilistcdn\/character\/large\/b5-RxGEMJZLW4cy.png"},{"Quote":"You can\u2019t sit around envying other people\u2019s worlds.

Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial \"D\".  \n\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades.

Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear towards his grandfather, to the point that he does not fight back and is intimidated at the mere mention of him.  \n\nLuffy never kills any of the villains, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or until the point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.  \n\nLuffy's dream is to find the One Piece and become Pirate King. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks.   \n\nMonkey D. Dragon is the father of Monkey D. Luffy and is also the son of Vice-Admiral Monkey D. Garp. Known as the Revolutionary Dragon, he is the world's most wanted criminal.  Before the start of the series, Dragon left Luffy in Garp's care. Dragon first appears after a lightning bolt suddenly destroys the gallows where Luffy was to be executed by Buggy the Clown and then saves Luffy from being captured by Captain Smoker. When he saved Luffy from Smoker, a mighty gust of eerie wind swept through Loguetown. It is undetermined whether or not he was the cause behind the gust of wind or the lightning; however, the story leads to believe there is more to him than it seems.

","Author":" Allen Walker","Summary":"__Age:__ 15; 16  \n__Birth Date:__ Unknown, December 25 (date of adoption)  \n__Height:__ 168 cm (5'6\"), now 170 cm (5'7\")   \n__Weight:__ 127.9 lbs (58 kg), now 55 kg (121 lbs) \n __Blood Type:__ O  \n__Nationality:__ British   \n__Fav Food:__ Mitarashi Dango  \n\nAllen is the main hero of the series. He was abandoned by his biological parents because of the supposed \"deformity\" of his left arm (which was later revealed to be caused by his Innocence). He was eventually found and adopted by a traveling performer named Mana Walker on Christmas Day. Some time later Mana died, and Allen, tormented with grief and manipulated by the Millennium Earl, turned Mana into an Akuma, hoping that his beloved surrogate father would be fully resurrected. But the Mana Akuma cursed Allen and sliced through his left eye, leaving the \"Pentacle\" \u2014 the mark of the Akuma \u2014 which scars the left side of his face. This enabled his left eye to see the souls trapped within the Akuma from then on. It was at this same moment that Allen's left arm first invoked as an Anti-Akuma weapon, which instinctively destroyed the Mana Akuma. During the course of this traumatic event, Allen's hair turned from brown into a stark white.  \n\nAllen eventually meets Cross Marian, a General of the Black Order, who explained to Allen the ways of the Akuma and the trapped souls within them: Once a soul becomes trapped inside an Akuma, they are trapped forever; and that the only way to save one is to exorcise them from their Akuma vessel. Allen subsequently became Cross' disciple and spent the next three years with him before being sent to the Black Order to become an official exorcist. During this time, Allen was tormented by his master's constant irresponsible behavior and forced into various odd-jobs to pay off the debts that General Cross accumulated. This, coupled with Marian's womanizing ways and harsh treatment towards Allen, led to Walker fearing more than respecting his master whom he never speaks fondly of. \n\nIn fact, when Jasdevi claims that Cross is like a demon, Allen denies this and instead insists that Cross is a real demon. In addition, when Jasdevi reveal that the debts Cross left to them total about 2 million yen, Allen grows demon horns, laughs at them, and calls their debts small change in comparison to his own, leaving Lavi to wonder just how much money Allen's been made to pay.  In addition to being physically fit and skilled at combat (as evident by his ability to fight and dodge Fou without the use of his Innocence), Allen has a few odd talents and skills. Because of the many debts Allen was forced into paying by Cross, he learned to play cards and gamble at a very young age, though his initial purpose was to practice his numb deformed left hand. He also learned how to cheat and win through deception and doesn't hesitate to use these tactics whenever necessary. In fact, he is quite proud of his talents. This is a stark contrast to his polite and courteous nature and often surprises his friends who wouldn't expect such a dark side to Allen and has caused them to wonder just what Cross has done to him. Walker also possesses circus abilities such as juggling and acrobatics, which he learned from traveling with Mana who was himself a circus clown by trade.  \n\nInspector Levrier and Cross have both referred to a \"player\" (as in one who plays a musical instrument), and Cross has hinted that there may be more than one.  Allen's synchronization ratio reached a maximum of 83% before having his Innocence destroyed by Tyki. Yet unknown to Allen, the Innocence lingered around as a hazy fog of particles; at the time, a direct reflection of his shattered state of mind. It wasn't until he came to an epiphany that he was able to seize control of his Anti-Akuma weapon once again and achieving his Innocence's true, fully-invoked form. When not activated, his arm is black and meets with his shoulder in a spiraling pattern that ends with tattoo-like emblem. Following this, the Order gave it the official designation of Crowned Clown (\u795e\u30ce\u9053\u5316\uff08\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30fb\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\uff09, Kuraun Kuraun), due to its jester-like appearance when invoked. The kanji used in the name literally translates to God's Clown (\u795e\u30ce\u9053\u5316, Kami no Douke). \n\nWhen invoked, Crowned Clown acts as a body-armored Innocence, forming a white-hooded cowl and sleeve of Innocence energy which covers his shoulders and right arm, while his left arm and hand become slender and black, clad in armor and razor sharp claws. A masquerade-style mask is always affixed to the cowl, which takes on various configurations and appearances. This transformation also changes Allen's usual hairstyle from flat to a spiky rear. As before, his Innocence possesses a certain degree of sentience, but as Crowned Crown is able to manipulate Allen's entire body like a marionette when incapacitated, or simply assisting in evasive tactics.","Image":"https:\/\/s4.anilist.co\/file\/anilistcdn\/character\/large\/b139-QnuZQbLodMF3.png"},{"Quote":"The moment you think of giving up, think of the reason why you held on so long.

His original name was Shinta (\u5fc3\u592a). \n\nHis parents died of cholera when he was very young and as a result, was adopted by three slave women in a traveling slave wagon. Soon after meeting them, bandits had raided the convoy and killed his three new guardians and where about to kill him when Seijuro Hiko killed the bandits. Hiko soon adopted the child and because Shinta was not a name fitted for a swordman, he renamed him Kenshin, meaning \"Heart of Sword,\" took him under his wing and taught him the Hiten Mitsuruugi Ryu.   \n\n However, before full completion of the sword style could be passed on to Kenshin, the Japanese Revolution had been happening at the time and right before Kenshin's eyes.  Because of his kind nature and seeing people suffering, he knew he needed to do something about it.  He left in the middle of his training and without his master's blessing and joined the Imperialists.  It was during the Revolution where Kenshin met Tomoe, his first love and wife. During the revolution, Kenshin was given the nickname of Hitokiri Battousai because of his god-like speed of drawing a sword to kill the enemy instantly. After helping the Imperialist to a position where they would undoubtedly win the revolution, Kenshin left the revolution all-together with a vow to never kill again and the reverse-blade sword handed to him by Shakku-dono. It was Tomoe's death by his hands that pushed him over the edge of never to kill again.\n\nThe next time we see Kenshin is 10 years later as he has become a wanderer who helps out anyone in need who is suffering right before his eyes. Those long 10 years have taken him from Kyoto, all over Japan to where we find him in episode one of the anime, in Tokyo, still keeping his vow never to kill again. It is here where he meets Kaoru Kamiya and his whole life begins to change once again.\n\nKenshin is usually depicted as a care-free swordsman who is very aloof and tends to be a bit simple-minded when it comes to living normally. He is seen to be doing many of the chores around the dojo that he stays at with Kaoru, (i.e., cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc.). He believes it is his way of repaying Kaoru with allowing him to stay at her dojo. (although it seems he has gotten attracted to kaoru in the end). However, his swordsmanship ranks among the elite as he is seen defeating every rival (with the exception of Hajime Saitou which ended in a draw). His battle senses are top-notch and he recognizes even the slightest of advantages, strategies and tactics during a sword battle.    \n\n(Source: kenshin.wikia.com)","Image":"https:\/\/s4.anilist.co\/file\/anilistcdn\/character\/large\/b147-uGS4OHKiCF35.png"},{"Quote":"What you can\u2019t accomplish alone, becomes doable when you\u2019re with someone else.

Like the Fourth, her \"Escape\" diary goes along with the type of profession she is involved in. Whenever Minene faces a dire situation, the diary will chart out the best course of actions she can take in order to get out of a tight spot. Based on the function of her diary, it might even help reduce the chances of her receiving a Dead End and it is probably one of the best diaries to have in Deus' game of survival. The diary's only shortcoming is that there are some circumstances where the odds are too heavily stacked against Minene to the point where the diary won't be able to secure an escape route for her.   An infamous atheistic terrorist, Minene is a young woman who bears a strong hatred for organized religion, particularly God.    Her hatred of religion stems from her past when she and parents were traveling in a city in the Middle East but got caught in a battle, which is hinted between Israelis and Palestinians, where her parents were killed in the crossfire. Blaming God for her parents death, she leads a crusade of destruction against those associated with God.   Minene got involved in the Diary game when after a failed assassination to kill a Catholic Cardinal, she tried to escape but almost fell to her death but was saved by Deus who gave her an offer to save her if she join his game. Minene's diary is the Escape Diary, which will chart out the best course of actions for her to escape whenever she finds herself in a dangerous situation. While it means she can escape anything, it is not perfect as the diary can only tell her how to escape if there are favorably conditions that allow her any chance to escape.   Originally, she wants to win the game to destroy religion worldwide but later mellows out after befriending Yuki and his friends. While she began as an antagonist against Yuki, she later became his ally, becoming a big sister figure to him and both of them hold no animosity with each other despite Minene was responsible for the destruction and deaths at his school and Yuki was the one who blinded her left eye. She shares an interesting relationship with Masumi Nishijima of the police whom she met during her failed assassination of the Cardinal. While she constantly dismisses all of his attempts to get to know her, she finally relents and eventually falls in love with Masumi.   In the anime, during the last episode it was shown that Minene, from the second world, and Masumi, from the third world live together and have two children. Third world Minene is still a terrorist.

She is an adolescent but very powerful sorceress, with a great love of money, treasure (especially the magical sort) and food. In the anime and manga (but not the light novel) Lina uses overly destructive magic recklessly (but comically), often with little provocation. She is reputed to be an evil, powerful, destructive, diminutive sorceress (the evil part isn't true). She has an older sister, Luna, who is a powerful swordswoman. Although Lina has faced down dragons, monsters, and even Dark Lords with little fear, the mere mention of Luna's name sends her into terrified hysterics. She also suffers from a fear of slugs.  In the first episode of the TV series, she introduces herself by destroying a gang of bandits known as the Dragon Fangs. She steals a large portion of their treasure, then sets off towards the nearest town to cash it in for a sizable profit. On the way to the town she is ambushed by the remainder of the Dragon Fangs. However, mere seconds before she would have blasted them to bits, Gourry Gabriev valiantly comes to her \"rescue\" and they begin their adventures together. In manga, anime and novels, Lina and Gourry do fall in love, but acting on these feelings is an entirely different story.  Lina has many different nicknames, one of them being \"Dragon Spooker\", a name that she isn't too fond of. This is rumored to have appeared because of an incident in the first episode, in which the Leader of the Dragon Fangs\u2019 pet black dragon escapes. Just when it appears that the beast is going to crush Lina (and Gourry, who was knocked out on top of her in a compromising position), it blanches in disgust and steps over her, a blush along its snout, much to her shock, and thereafter rage. However, the nickname was mentioned before the black dragon met her, thus leading to a possible earlier incident.  Another nickname Lina encounters is the \"Dragon Nester.\" This comes from a rhyme: \"Little girl with little breasts, scares the dragon from its nest.\" This takes off from a running gag, in which characters constantly comment on the small size of Lina's breasts. She generally takes offense to these comments, and often responds with violence. This nickname only appears in the English dub but small breast jokes are a staple of the franchise.  In Slayers TRY, Gourry, Amelia and Zelgadis find out that Lina has an elder sister named Luna. Luna is a skilled and powerful warrior, who later retired and became a waitress in Lina's hometown. When Lina refused to accompany Filia on her quest, Filia handed Lina a letter from Luna that said, \"Shut up and do it!\", prompting Lina to cower in fear.

Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms before suddenly and nonchalantly obliterating them with one punch.\n\n(Source: One Punch-Man Wikia)","Image":"https:\/\/s4.anilist.co\/file\/anilistcdn\/character\/large\/73935-WX4ViYPuZhs5.jpg"},{"Quote":"People with talent often have the wrong impression that things will go as they think.

","Author":"Madara Uchiha","Summary":" __Birthday:__ December 24\n __Classification:__ Missing-nin  \n__Occupation:__ Co-founder of Konohagakure, Leader of the Uchiha clan  \n__Affiliation:__ Konohagakure  \n__Clan:__ Uchiha clan  \n__Manga Debut:__ Chapter #370  \n__Anime Debut:__ Naruto Shipp\u016bden Episode #130  \n\nMadara Uchiha (\u3046\u3061\u306f\u30de\u30c0\u30e9, Uchiha Madara) was a legendary ninja who led the Uchiha clan prior to and after the formation of Konohagakure.  Before the era of ninja villages, Madara and his younger brother, Izuna, were considered the most gifted members of the Uchiha clan. Even by his clan's standards, Madara's chakra was especially strong. He grew up constantly competing and training with Izuna and in their efforts to surpass each other, each gained their own Mangeky\u014d Sharingan. With the power of the Mangeky\u014d the two brothers took control of the clan, with Madara as its leader. Under his leadership, the clan conquered all they came across. Because of the never-ending series of battles of the time, Madara eventually began to suffer from overuse of the Mangeky\u014d Sharingan, leaving him blind. In order to regain his sight he took Izuna's eyes for himself, granting him an \"eternal\" Mangeky\u014d Sharingan with which he led the Uchiha clan to prosperity.  Over the years, the Uchiha had constantly fought with the equally powerful Senju clan and as such, Madara had an undying rivalry with Hashirama Senju, the leader of the Senju clan. To bring an end to the constant fighting, Hashirama approached the Uchiha with an offer of peace. Although Madara never wanted peace with the Senju, the rest of the Uchiha wished to end the fighting, and Madara had no choice but to accept. The Senju, the Uchiha, and all the clans they had conquered came together to form the village of Konohagakure.  Some time later, the villagers of Konoha selected Hashirama as the village's first Hokage much to Madara's dismay. Madara feared that Hashirama would oppress the Uchiha, and tried to rally support for challenging his leadership. Rather than help him, the Uchiha turned their backs on him, believing he only desired to rekindle the flames of war.  Soon after being rejected the position of Hokage and being abandoned by his clan, Madara left the village, and sought out Nine-Tails. He later returned in order to challenge Hashirama in battle. They fought at the site that would someday be called the Valley of the End, where Madara was defeated, despite having Nine-Tails at his side. Control of Nine-Tails was ultimately taken from him and Madara was believed to have died.   During the Fourth Shinobi World War, after Nagato is sealed by the recently freed Uchiha Itachi, Kabuto uses his 'trump card' by having M\u016b use the Impure World Resurrection to summon the 'real' Uchiha Madara (then-proving that Tobi is merely using the his namesake, and that he is in fact not Madara). After being resurrected, Madara also shows his ability to utilize not only his Sharingan and Mangekyou Sharingan abilities, but also those of the Rinnegan and Wood Jutsu.","Image":"https:\/\/s4.anilist.co\/file\/anilistcdn\/character\/large\/b53901-RTUFWDZAS3c3.jpg"},{"Quote":"Love is the reason why there is a pain. When we lose someone precious to us, hate is born. Vengeance is the product of that hate and so death follows. But in death, there is only more death. This will give rise to more pains. In this cursed world we live in, it is a cycle of hatred that will not cease. You and I seek the same thing that Jiraiya-sensei wanted. Let me ask you this: How will you confront this hatred in order to create peace? ","Author":"Pain","Summary":"Pain is the recognized leader of Akatsuki, partnered to Konan, with Tobi acting as his benefactor. He is the principal figure in the tailed beast sealing ceremony.   The first and leading \"Pain\" appearing in the series is actually Yahiko, one of six animated corpses collectively known as \"The Six Paths of Pain\" that are all controlled by one person's will[ch. 378, 419]: Nagato of Amegakure. At a young age, Nagato was secretly visited by Madara Uchiha who implanted his Rinnegan (lit. \"Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra Eye\") into the child's body, giving him the ability to use abilities based on the six Buddhist paths of reincarnation. Orphaned, Nagato met fellow orphans Konan and Yahiko before they are all trained by Jiraiya. Nagato desired peace for the world, aiding Yahiko to create the Akatsuki to achieve that shared dream. However, a trap laid by Amegakure's dictator Hanzo led to Yahiko's death, causing Nagato to take over as the new leader of the organization. Though the encounter crippled Nagato, the experience of having his best friend die caused Nagato to come to the realization that peace could only be attained by teaching the world the pain caused by war.  To that end he adopted the alias \"Pain\" to conquer Amegakure and invented the Six Path of Pain to overcome his handicap and kill Hanzo, becoming a \"god\" in the eyes of Amegakure's citizens. Having made cosmetically alterations to the other Paths by dying their hair to match Yahiko's, the Paths are all outfitted with a number of body piercings that serve as a means for Nagato to control them and to give them a \"more dangerous\" appearance in relation to their name's installation. Through Nagato's Rinnegan, they can also share visual information and coordinate attacks.  Jiraiya would later confront Nagato regarding his role as \"Pain\", the leader of Akatsuki. The two would fight with Nagato dismissing his former mentor's ideals as well as killing him. During Pain's attack on Konoha, the six Paths are defeated by Naruto. Talking with Naruto, Nagato renews his faith in his late master and in the possibility of peace. Nagato sacrifices his life in order to revive the people he killed in Konoha.[ch. 449] Nagato is later resurrected by Kabuto and sent alongside Itachi to battle Naruto and Killer Bee, but is sent back to the afterlife.
